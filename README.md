# Chatbot-LangChai
RAG with LangChain is performed in two general steps:
First Indexing, which allows data to be ingested from a source to be indexed and second,
Retrieval and Generation is when the real RAG chain receives the user query at
runtime and retrieves the required data from the index before passing it to the
model.
LangChain is an open-source framework designed to make constructing applications powered
by large language models (LLMs) simpler. It allows developers to use the power of LLM in
activities including document analysis, chatbot generation, and code analysis by providing a
continuous supply of building blocks and pre-built chains to develop massive language model
applications.
